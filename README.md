# Description
This project analyzes NYC taxi and Uber trip data combined with local weather information to explore travel patterns and trends. We cleaned and processed the raw data, stored the refined data in an SQLite database, and used SQL queries to answer key questions such as peak travel times and the impact of weather on trips. Finally, we visualized the analysis results to clearly reveal the relationship between travel behavior and weather factors.
